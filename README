Remember to run this before refreshing webpage ...
cljsc hello.cljs > hello.js

If dont have it open already do
firefox index.html

- Noticed firefox in debug console throws an error for hello.js - 
looks like this is a dependency issue with goog - though in this
specific example it seems to work anyway.

When I try doing other things - the webpage no longer works.

After looking around it appears - we need to run closurebuilder.py
to build the depencies.  I followed the example online - 
for this https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/closurebuilder 
and it works.

Though now if I try using the clojurescript to javascript compiled file
in that example - the dependency builder fails with this:

```
developer@xubuntu-developer:~/projects/knockout_git$ ./builddepsmyproject.sh
closure-library/closure/bin/build/closurebuilder.py: Scanning paths...
closure-library/closure/bin/build/closurebuilder.py: 1343 sources scanned.
closure-library/closure/bin/build/closurebuilder.py: Building dependency tree..
Traceback (most recent call last):

    tree = depstree.DepsTree(sources)

depstree.MultipleProvideError: Namespace "goog.array.ArrayLike" provided more than once in sources:
PathSource closure-library/closure/goog/array/array.js
PathSource myproject/out/goog/array/array.js
```

I looked around online a bit and didnt find anything helpful - except an
outstanding ticket for a similar issue... from 2012.

I'll check this stuff in - the next thing I am going to look at is cljsbuild
with lein and see if I can make any progress with that instead.

I can understand the dependency problem above because the clojurescript builder
is a tool that is not part of the closure library - though it appears it is
trying
to be compatible with it because the hello.js file includes adding dependencies
for goog.  So If I had to guess there is some incompatibility now with the new
  deps builder possibly and the javascript the cljsc compiler generates.

I made some sh scripts to help document compiling of the hello.cljs and also to 
build the dependencies.
